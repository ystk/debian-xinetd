xinetd (1:2.3.14-6) unstable; urgency=low

  Thanks to David Madore, xinetd now is able to listen on IPv6 addresses for
  inetd.conf compatibility layer. This is now the new default mode for xinetd
  in Debian.

xinetd (1:2.3.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  This version enables inetd_compat mode by default, so that we can pretend to
  be a real inet-superserver. This way, packages that use update-inetd will
  work with xinetd properly. The inetd_compat mode is forced for new
  installations only, and can be tweaked in /etc/default/xinetd.

  Note that if the same service is configured in /etc/xinetd.d/ and in
  /etc/inetd.conf, the former takes precedence, based on the service id.
