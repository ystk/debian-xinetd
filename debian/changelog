xinetd (1:2.1.8.8.p3-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - fix a bug in the access lists; if you specified a host by
      name in "only_from," any connection from a host without
      a reverse DNS entry would be accepted
    This means that security policies (e.g. denial of access) for such hosts
    wouldn't be enforced, which is a very ugly security problem,
    closes: #65757.
  * Add a clear warning to the postrm in the case when you don't have
    an init script for the original inetd anymore, saying you may need
    to reinstall netbase package to fix it. As this may happen due to
    severe breakage in an old xinetd package. (Closes: #60836)
  * Clarify convert-inetd-conf template text to explicitely say that the
    config file will get overwritten on every upgrade if you say "Yes" to
    the question, and add two lines in postinst to explain how to make it
    not regenerate anymore.
  * Sync portmapper check with inetd's init script and enhance the regexp
    match to catch " # foo" comments, otherwise it may produce a false
    warning.
  * Move the message about terminating all services to prerm, where it's
    actually being done.
  * Make update-rc.d run only on initial installs.
  * Add debhelper to Build-Depends: and short the long description.

  * Introduce debconf support to ask about converting the config file,

    the old method of asking the questions yet, just in case debconf
    doesn't exist. Only Recommends: debconf. Plus, I had to re-route all
    the messages to &2, because of debconf.
  * Add the missing `k' in `syslogd' recommendation.
  * Add Build-Depends: libwrap0-dev.
  * Move the whole contents of preinst to postinst (that is, stopping of
    inetd and portmap, and creating the diversion of inetd init file),
    no need to abuse preinst for that.
  * Use --background option for start-stop-daemon, to speed up loading,
    thus having to depend on dpkg >= 1.4.1.17.
  * Fix some details in postinst, init.d, config, and copyright files.

  * Update packaging files for the new autoconf stuff, patch configure.in
    and Makefile.in to support install in custom non-existant directories,
    include sample xinetd.conf file in examples directory.
  * Updated docs regarding the new xconv.pl script. Not using it in
    postinst, at least not yet.
  * Drop all old patches, except the one for src/itox.c, which is now
    forwarded/included in upstream package, with some others.
  * Add --with-libwrap to configure flags, to link with libwrap0, as
    suggested by the upstream author in the README.
  * Fix postrm script to work on purge, and to remove /etc/init.d/inetd
    (created in postinst) prior to un-diverting it (otherwise dpkg-divert
    would bomb out, overwriting not allowed).
  * Move making the dummy /etc/init.d/inetd script to postinst, to
    avoid the lintian error.
  * Fix s/daemon-dir/daemon_dir/ in README.update-inetd file.
  * Update itox.1 manual page, move it to section 8 and to xinetd/
    directory, and integrate it (and itox) in the Makefile install: rule.
  * Update the init script, made checkportmap() check in /etc/xinetd.conf
    file (don't know whether the check is ultimately correct, though).
  * Upgrade netbase dependency to 3.16-4, because the fixed update-inetd
    script is included since that version.
  * Don't recommend netstd anymore, apparently it no longer exists.

xinetd (2.2.1-8.SD1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Add a dummy /etc/init.d/inetd script so netbase doesn't have to
    worry about its files disappearing. (Closes: #45602)

xinetd (2.2.1-8.SD1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload (is Norber Veber MIA?).
  * Update for the new netbase/inetd stuff.
    (Closes: #43161, #44537, #44529, #31500)
  * Depend on an appropriate netbase version because of the switch to
    diverting /etc/init.d/inetd, and not diverting /usr/sbin/update-inetd.
  * Un-diverting is done in a sane way, I think. Postinst checks whether the
    exact diversion still exists, and preserves the obsolete scripts, with
    suffix ".xinetd.old", and then removes the diversion. The obsolete files
    made this way are "rm -f"ed in postrm.
  * Update for Debian Policy 3.x. Converte to debhelper for full Policy
    compliance. (Closes: #44099)
  * Add rm -f /etc/xinetd.conf in purging of postrm. (Closes: #36809)
  * Apply large patch by <solar@false.com> for the following changes: (Closes: 35166)
    - Supplementary groups are now dropped by default instead of setting
      them according to /etc/group. The old behavior was dangerous, as root
      is usually a member of multiple groups and some daemons don't reset
      them even when dropping to the authenticated user.
    - On a SIGHUP, writes to /var/run/xinetd.dump, not /tmp/xinetd.dump.
    - A theoretical race condition is fixed.
    - Per-source-address session count limits, separate for each service.
      The option is "per_source" (works in the defaults section, too). Its
      usage is similar to the "instances" option.
    - New option for services: "groups = yes" can be used to enable the
      old behavior for supplementary groups.
    - The ability to pass server arguments starting with argv[0], via the
      added "server_args0" option.
  * Rework most of the maintainer scripts.
  * The checkportmap() function, from the inetd's init script ought to
    be changed to check in /etc/xinetd.conf file.
  * Improve debian/README* files, fixed some oddities in "SEE ALSO"
    sections of the man pages.
  * If this release doesn't break anything, I'll probably upload the newest
    upstream version, from the alive branch.

xinetd (2.2.1-8) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Apply itox patch by Alain Nissen <Alain.Nissen@ulg.ac.be>,
    it fixes two problems with itox. It now understands the user.group
    notation, and ignores (no)wait.max. (Closes: #29951)
  * Fix commenting syntax in preinst (/* */ -> #). (Closes: #29650)
  * Fix typo in the itox man page. (Closes: #29945)
  * slattach is no longer killed when xinetd is stopped. (Closes: #29648)
  * Fix a /tmp security problem which occured when xinetd was sent the
    HUP signal (patch from Bugtraq by Marc Heuse <marc@SUSE.DE> slightly
    modified by me).

xinetd (2.2.1-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Change all scripts that stop xinetd so that they use SIGQUIT to kill the
    server. SIGTERM is the default, and this causes xinetd to kill all
    child processes, which makes remote installation/maintenance impossible.
  * Change postrm so that it calls update-rc.d with the -f option (in case
    /etc/init.d/xinetd is still present.
  * Change prerm so that it stops /sbin/portmap instead of
    /usr/sbin/rpc.portmap (which doesn't exist).
  * Add a man page for itox.
  * Fix /etc/init.d/xinetd reload/restart.
  * Add /etc/init.d/xinetd to list of conffiles.

xinetd (2.2.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New maintainer.
  * Divert /etc/init.d/netbase. (Closes: #19125)
  * /etc/init.d/xinetd now refers to itself by $0. (Closes: #6860)
  * /etc/init.d/xinetd now looks for /sbin/portmap.
    (Closes: #12021, #12047, #14159, #17247, #18691, #20701, #22161)
  * Divert /usr/sbin/update-inetd, the new update-inetd now tells the user
    to manually edit /etc/xinetd.conf. A new update-inetd that changes
    the xinetd.conf will eventually be created.
  * Create /usr/doc/xinetd/README-update.inetd which describes the above,
    and gives pointers on what to put into xinetd.conf.
  * Move back to main from non-free since xinetd is now free.
  * Include ORIGINAL copyright, as is required by the license.
    It is in /usr/doc/xinetd/copyright.
  * Create /usr/doc/README.samba which describes a fix/workaround to the
    xinetd/nmdb bug (Closes: #20705, #17907).
  * No longer provides a default xinetd.conf. It is nearly impossible to
    generate one that will work on all systems, and still provides
    useful services. The user now has the choice of keeping the current
    configuration, or converting inetd.conf. (Closes: #10059)
