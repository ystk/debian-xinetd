xinetd (1:2.1.8.8.p3-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, which includes just a few bugfixes, most of them
    that aren't even related to Linux, but there is one which is rather
    important:
        Fixed a bug in the access lists.  If you specified a host by
                name in only_from, any connection from a host without
                a reverse dns entry would be accepted.
    This means that security policies (e.g. denial of access) for such hosts
    wouldn't be enforced, which is a very ugly security problem,
    closes: #65757.
  * Added a clear warning to the postrm in the case when you don't have
    an init script for the original inetd anymore, saying you may need
    to reinstall netbase package to fix it. As this may happen due to
    severe breakage in an old xinetd package, it needs to be said,
    closes: #60836.
  * Clarified convert-inetd-conf template text to explicitely say that the
    config file will get overwritten on every upgrade if you say "Yes" to
    the question, and add two lines in postinst to explain how to make it
    not regenerate anymore.
  * Synced portmapper check with inetd's init script and enhanced the regexp
    match to catch " # foo" comments, otherwise it may produce false warning.
  * Moved the message about terminating all services to prerm, where it's
    actually being done.
  * Made update-rc.d run only on initial installs.
  * Added debhelper to Build-Depends: and shortened the long description.

xinetd (1:2.1.8.8pre6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, packaged only to fix the Y2K glitch in the
    log file, closes: #53865.
  * Adopted/tookover the package :) I hear Norbert is around, but he
    hasn't contacted anyone regarding the package yet.
  * Introducing debconf support, to ask about converting the config file,
    and to warn about update-inetd malfunctioning. However, I didn't remove
    the old method of asking the questions yet, just in case debconf
    doesn't exist. Only Recommends: debconf. Plus, I had to re-route all
    the messages to &2, because of debconf.
  * Added the missing `k' in `syslogd' recommendation (doh!). Added
    Build-Depends: libwrap0-dev.
  * Moved the whole contents of preinst to postinst (that is, stopping of
    inetd and portmap, and creating the diversion of inetd init file),
    no need to abuse preinst for that.
  * Use --background option for start-stop-daemon, to speed up loading,
    thus having to depend on dpkg >= 1.4.1.17.
  * Fixed some details in postinst, init.d, config, and copyright files.

xinetd (1:2.1.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Admitting the sad truth, i.e. marking the package as orphaned. Norbert
    hasn't done an upload in some eleven months, and hasn't respondedÃÂto
    our NMUs and several e-mails in more than two months. :(
  * New upstream version. It's from a completely different development
    branch, versioned differently, so I had to introduce an epoch. :|
    Note that we *have to* use this version because the previous one breaks
    its own original license! Closes: #38361 #41386 #41568.
  * Updated packaging files for the new autoconf stuff, patched configure.in
    and Makefile.in to support install in custom non-existant directories,
    included example xinetd.conf file in examples directory.
  * Updated docs regarding the new xconv.pl script. Not using it in
    postinst, at least not yet.
  * Skipped all old patches, except the one for src/itox.c, which is now
    forwarded/included in upstream package, with some others.
  * Added --with-libwrap to configure flags, to link with libwrap0, as
    suggested by the upstream author. From the README file:
       When xinetd does access checking, it will first ask libwrap to check
       /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny, then if libwrap accepts the
       connection, xinetd will consult its own access control mechanism.
  * Fixed postrm script to work on purge, and to remove /etc/init.d/inetd
    (created in postinst) prior to un-diverting it (otherwise dpkg-divert
    would bomb out, overwriting not allowed).
  * Moved making the dummy /etc/init.d/inetd script to postinst, to
    avoid the lintian error.
  * Fixed s/daemon-dir/daemon_dir/ in README.update-inetd file.
  * Updated itox.1 manual page, moved it to section 8 and to xinetd/
    directory, and integrated it (and itox) in the Makefile install: rule.
  * Updated the init script, made checkportmap() check in /etc/xinetd.conf
    file (don't know whether the check is ultimately correct, though).
  * Upgraded netbase dependency to 3.16-4, because the fixed update-inetd
    script is included since that version.
  * Doesn't recommend netstd anymore, apparently it no longer exists,
    that closes: #49398 #49438.

    Fixes: #43161 #44537 #44529 #31500
  * Depend on an appropriate netbase version because of the switch to
    diverting /etc/init.d/inetd, and not diverting /usr/sbin/update-inetd. 
  * Un-diverting is done in a sane way, I think. Postinst checks whether the
    exact diversion still exists, and preserves the obsolete scripts, with
    suffix ".xinetd.old", and then removes the diversion. The obsolete files
    made this way are "rm -f"ed in postrm.
  * Updated for Policy 3.x. Converted to debhelper for full Policy
    compliance. Fixes: #44099
  * Added rm -f /etc/xinetd.conf under purging in postrm, fixes: #36809
  * Included Solar Designer <solar@false.com>'s SD1 patch from:
    ftp://ftp.dataforce.net/pub/solar/xinetd-2.2.1-SD1.diff , fixes: #35166
  * Reworked most of the maintainer scripts.
  * The checkportmap() function, from the inetd's init script ought to
    be changed to check in /etc/xinetd.conf file.
  * Beautified debian/README* files, fixed some oddities in "SEE ALSO"
    sections of the man pages.
  * If this release doesn't break anything, I'll probably upload the newest
    upstream version, from the alive branch.

xinetd (2.2.1-8) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Bug #29951, Applied itox patch by Alain Nissen <Alain.Nissen@ulg.ac.be>,
    it fixes two problems with itox.  It now understands user.group
    notation, and ignores (no)wait.max.
  * Bug #29650, changed a /* */ comment in preinst to a bash # comment :)
  * Bug #29945, typo in the itox man page.
  * Bug 29648, slattach is no longer killed when xinetd is stopped.
  * Fixed a /tmp security problem which occured when xinetd was sent the
    HUP signal (patch from Bugtraq by Marc Heuse <marc@SUSE.DE> slightly 
    modified by me).

xinetd (2.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed #24246, debian/files and debian/substvars is no longer included
    with the deb.
  * Fixed #24245.  This closes a security hole and policy violation in the
    build process, also changed to -O2 while compiling.

xinetd (2.2.1-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed all scripts that stop xinetd so that they use SIGQUIT to kill the
    server.  SIGTERM is the default, and this causes xinetd to kill all
    child processes, which makes remote installation/maintenance impossible.
  * Changed postrm so that it calls update-rc.d with the -f option (in case
    /etc/init.d/xinetd is still present.
  * changed prerm so that it stops /sbin/portmap instead of
    /usr/sbin/rpc.portmap (which doesnt exist)
  * Wrote a man page for itox
  * Fixed /etc/init.d/xinetd reload/restart
  * Added /etc/init.d/xinetd to list of conffiles

xinetd (2.2.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New developer
  * Diverted /etc/init.d/netbase, fixes bug #19125
  * /etc/init.d/xinetd now refers to itself by $0, bug #6860
  * /etc/init.d/xinetd now looks for /sbin/portmap, bug #12021, #12047,
    #14159, #17247, #18691, #20701, #22161
  * Diverted /usr/sbin/update-inetd, the new update-inetd now tells the user
    to manually edit /etc/xinetd.conf.  A new update-inetd that changes
    the xinetd.conf will eventually be created.
  * Created /usr/doc/xinetd/README-update.inetd which describes the above,
    and gives pointers on what to put into xinetd.conf.
  * Moved back to main (xinetd is free)
  * Included ORIGINAL copyright, as is required by the license.  
    It is in /usr/doc/xinetd/copyright.
  * Created /usr/doc/README.samba which describes a fix/workaround to the
    xinetd/nmdb bug (#20705 and #17907).
  * No longer provides a default xinetd.conf.  It is nearly impossible to
    generate one that will work on all systems, and still provides
    useful services.  The user now has the choice of keeping the current
    configuration, or converting inetd.conf.
    This fixes half of bug #10059. :)
