<strong><a name="what">Q. What is xinetd ?</a><br></strong>
A. xinetd is a replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon.<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="care">Q: I am not a system administrator; what do I care about an inetd replacement ?</a></strong>
<br>
A: xinetd is not just an inetd replacement. Anybody can use it to start servers
	that don't require privileged ports because xinetd does not require that the 
	services in its configuration file be listed in /etc/services.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="compat">Q. Is it compatible with inetd ?</a><br></strong>
A. No, its configuration file has a different format than inetd's one
   and it understands different signals. However the signal-to-action 
	assignment can be changed and a program has been included to convert 
	inetd.conf to xinetd.conf.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="why">Q. Why should I use it ?</a><br></strong>
A. Because it is a lot better (IMHO) than inetd. Here are the reasons:
<br>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>      1) It can do access control on all services based on:
	<dl>
   <dt>         a. address of remote host
   <dt>         b. time of access
   <dt>         c. name of remote host
   <dt>         d. domain name of remote host
	</dl>
<dt>      2) Access control works on all services, whether multi-threaded or
         single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP protocols.
         All UDP packets can be checked as well as all TCP connections.

<dt>      3) It provides hard reconfiguration:
	<dl>
   <dt>         a. kills servers for services that are no longer in the
               configuration file
   <dt>         b. kills servers that no longer meet the access control criteria
	</dl>
<dt>      4) It can prevent denial-of-access attacks by
   <dl>
   <dt>        a. placing limits on the number of servers for each service
               (avoids process table overflows)
   <dt>         b. placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
   <dt>         c. placing limits on the size of log files it creates
   <dt>         d. placing limits on the number of connection a single host can initiate
   <dt>         e. place limits on the rate of incoming connections
   <dt>         f. discontinue services if the load exceeds specified limit
	</dl>
<dt>      5) Extensive logging abilities:
	<dl>
   <dt>         a. for every server started it can log:
		<dl>
      <dt>              i) the time when the server was started
      <dt>            ii) the remote host address
      <dt>           iii) who was the remote user (if the other end runs a
                       RFC-931/RFC-1413 server)
      <dt>            iv) how long the server was running
      <dt>        (i, ii and iii can be logged for failed attempts too).
		</dl>
    <dt>        b. for some services, if the access control fails, it can
               log information about the attempted access (for example,
               it can log the user name and command for the rsh service)
	</dl>
<dt>      6) No limit on number of server arguments
<dt>      7) You can bind specifc services to specific IP's on your host machine
</dl>

<strong><a name="who">Q. Whom should I thank/blame for this program ?</a><br></strong>
A. panos@cs.colorado.edu originally wrote this program, but 
<a href="mailto:bbraun@synack.net">I</a> am fielding
bug reports at this time.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="2.2">Q. What's up with 2.2.1 version of xinetd?</a></strong>
<br>
A. The most recent original version of xinetd was 2.1.1 with patches bringing it up to 2.1.8.  Nick Hilliard created xinetd 2.2.1, based off an unreleased xinetd 2.2.0 by Panos.  The copyright included with xinetd specified the required versioning to be the official release of xinetd (2.1.8 in this case) and a fourth version number tacked on to indicate the modification level.  This is the versioning I have adopted.  xinetd 2.1.8.X, which is available here, is not based off xinetd 2.2.0 or higher.  It was created from the codebase of xinetd 2.1.8, although I have re-implemented some of the features introduced in xinetd-2.2.1.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="where">Q. Where can I find the latest-and-greatest version ?</a><br></strong>
A. The xinetd source can be obtained from 
<a href="http://www.synack.net/xinetd">http://www.synack.net/xinetd</a>
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="qmail">Q. Has anyone been able to get qmail working with xinetd?</a><br></strong>
A. yes, here is the entry info
<pre>
service smtp
{
        flags           = REUSE NAMEINARGS
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        wait            = no
        user            = qmaild
        server          = /usr/sbin/tcpd
        server_args     = /var/qmail/bin/tcp-env -R /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd
}
</pre> Contributed by: Anthony Abby<br>
This method will allow you to set environment variables and whatnot
in <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt>.  Although xinetd can be compiled with libwrap
support, this doesn't mean it can completly replace tcpd's functionality.
xinetd calls <tt>host_access()</tt>, which performs the access control
documented in <tt>host_access(5)</tt> man page.  This is a subset of the
features offered by tcpd.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="support">Q. What platforms is xinetd know to work on?</a><br></strong>
A. I have run it on Solaris 2.6 (sparc and x86), Linux, BSDi, and 
IRIX 5.3 and 6.2.  The original package ran on SunOS 4 and Ultrix.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="chroot">Q. How to do setup a chrooted environment for a service?</a></strong><br>
A. Here is the config file entry:
<pre>
service telnet_chroot
{
        log_on_success  = HOST PID DURATION USERID
        log_on_failure 	= HOST RECORD USERID
	no_access 	= 152.30.11.93
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
	port 		= 8000
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /usr/sbin/chroot
	server_args 	= /var/public/servers /usr/libexec/telnetd
}
</pre> Contributed by: lburns@sasquatch.com
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="itox">Q. How do I use itox?</a></strong><br>
A. itox reads in a regular inetd.conf file from stdin and writes an xinetd.conf
file to stdout.  In general, you use the command:<br>
<tt>itox &lt /etc/inetd.conf &gt /etc/xinetd.conf</tt>
<br>
If your inetd.conf does not have explicit paths to each of the 
daemons, you must use the <i>-daemon_dir</i> option.  Suppose all your
daemons live in /usr/sbin, use the following command:<br>
<tt> itox -daemon_dir=/usr/sbin &lt /etc/inetd.conf &gt /etc/xinetd.conf</tt>
<br>
itox is rather old and hasn't been updated for a while.  xconv.pl is a
perl script that is a little better about converting modern inetd.conf
files.  It's usage is similar to itox's.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="libwrap">Q. Does xinetd support libwrap (tcpwrappers)?</a></strong><br>
A. Yes.  xinetd can be compiled with libwrap support by passing 
<tt>--with-libwrap</tt> as an option to the <tt>configure</tt> script.  
When xinetd is compiled with libwrap support, all services can use the 
<tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> and <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> access control.  
xinetd can also be configured to use tcpd in the traditional inetd style.  
This requires the use of the NAMEINARGS flag, and the name of the real
daemon be passed in as server_args.  Here is an example for using telnet 
with tcpd:
<pre>
service telnet
{
	flags       = REUSE NAMEINARGS
	protocol    = tcp
	socket_type = stream
	wait        = no
	user        = telnetd
	server      = /usr/sbin/tcpd
	server_args = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
}
</pre>
<strong><a name="ipv6">Q. Does xinetd support IPv6?</a></strong><br>
A.  Yes.  xinetd can be compiled with IPv6 support by adding the
<tt>--with-inet6</tt> option to the <tt>configure</tt> script.
Access control is functional with IPv6.  You can use ipv4 mapped
addresses, or give normal dotted quad ipv4 addresses for access
control, and xinetd will map them to ipv6 addresses.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="v6error">Q. No services start with IPv6!  What's the deal?</a></strong><br>
A.  When you compile IPv6 support in, all sockets are IPv6 sockets.
If your kernel doesn't understand what an IPv6 socket is, all attempts
to create sockets will fail, and no services will start.  Only compile
xinetd with IPv6 support if your kernel supports IPv6.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="bsd">Q. What's this setgroups(0, NULL) error?</a></strong><br>
A.  By default, xinetd does not allow group permissions to the server
processes, and it does this by setting the groups of the child process
to nothing.  Some BSD's have a problem with this.  To avoid this error,
put the directive <tt>groups = yes</tt> into your services.  This says
to allow the server process to have all the group privleges entitled
to the user the server process is running as.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="telnet">Q. Why can't telnetd start normally on Linux?</a></strong><br>
A. On some Linux distributions, the telnet daemon starts as a nonprivleged
user, but the user belongs to groups that allow it to open new tty's, and
to update utmp.  By default, xinetd does not allow group permissions to the
server process, so telnetd can fail to start properly.  To get the server
process to posess the proper groups, use the <tt>groups = yes</tt> directive
for the telnet service.  This will tell xinetd that it is OK for the server
process to start with all the groups the user has access to.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="stunnel">Q. How do I use xinetd to wrap SSL around services</a></strong><br>
A. Use the program <a href="http://www.stunnel.org">
stunnel</a> to wrap SSL around services.  This can actually be used
by an inetd.
<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="cvss">Q. How do I setup a cvs server with xinetd?</a>
</strong><br>
A.  A user wrote in with this suggestion: <BR>
<pre>
cvspserver  stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/cvs cvs --allow-root=/home/pauljohn/cvsroot  --allow-root=/home/pauljohn/cvsmisc pserver
</pre>
If you want to make the same work under xinetd, you save a config file
in /etc/xinetd.d
called cvspserver, (where the last line tells it the names of your
repositories):
<pre>
service cvspserver
{
	socket_type         = stream
	protocol            = tcp
	wait                = no
	user                = root
	passenv             = 
	server              = /usr/bin/cvs
	server_args         = --allow-root=/home/pauljohn/cvsroot --allow-root=/home/pauljohn/cvsmisc pserver -f
}
</pre>
All the other cvs setup stuff is the same.  This seems to work, afaik.
